Sentiment Analytics Framework

My first cut of a python-based Sentiment Analytics framework that canvases cryptotwitter sentiments towards a particular project/personality.

It runs on live twitter data via the Twitter API and uses an existing machine learning dataset to train the sentiment analysis model. 

This concept isn't new but it obviously would need a lot more training to be aware of nuances on cryptotwitter.

I've also set the retrieval to time out after 15 seconds to avoid spamming the twitter API.

Inspiration from the following projects:
